    "## Waist to Hip Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The waist-hip ratio or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is the dimensionless ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H). For example, a person with a 30″ (76 cm) waist and 38″ (97 cm) hips has a waist-hip ratio of about 0.78. The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. WHR correlates with fertility (with different optimal values in males and females). \n",
    "\n",
    "The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. Research shows that people with \"apple-shaped\" bodies (more weight around the waist) face more health risks than those with \"pear-shaped\" bodies (more weight around the hips).\n",
    "\n",
    "WHR is used as a measurement of obesity, which in turn is a possible indicator of other more serious health conditions. The WHO states that abdominal obesity is defined as a waist-hip ratio above 0.90 for males and above 0.85 for females, or a body mass index (BMI) above 30.0.[5] The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) states that women with waist-hip ratios of more than 0.8, and men with more than 1.0, are at increased health risk because of their fat distribution. - Wikipedia \n",
